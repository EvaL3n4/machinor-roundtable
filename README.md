# Machinor Roundtable

A SillyTavern extension that acts as your **Narrative Coordinator**.

The Machinor Roundtable extension silently analyzes your roleplay sessions and injects intelligent, context-aware guidance into the chat stream. It helps maintain narrative consistency, manages story pacing, and provides creative plot hooks—all without breaking character or interrupting your immersion.

## Key Features

* **Intelligent Plot Engine**: Analyzes chat history, character personalities, and world info to generate coherent narrative suggestions.
* **Seamless Context Injection**: Injects guidance directly into the LLM's prompt stream, influencing the AI's response without visible clutter.
* **Dynamic Pacing Control**: Monitors story beats and suggests pacing adjustments (e.g., "slow down for emotional impact" or "introduce conflict").
* **Narrative Arc Management**: Tracks long-term story phases (Introduction, Rising Action, Climax, Resolution) to ensure satisfying story structures.
* **Customizable Styles**: Choose from various narrative styles (Dramatic, Natural, Mysterious, etc.) to match your roleplay tone.
